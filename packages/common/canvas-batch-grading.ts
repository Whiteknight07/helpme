 * A batch run freezes the Canvas quiz/assignment catalog, the detected
 * question mapping, and the fixed final-mode instruction. One worker job then
 * discovers every eligible completed attempt, grades each mapped question,
 * persists the validated result, and prefills the per-question scores and
 * comments into SpeedGrader. HelpMe never posts or releases grades: Canvas is
 * left on manual posting so the prefilled scores stay hidden until staff review
 * them.
 *
 * The durable state is exactly two tables: a run and its attempts. Everything
 * per-question (answer, frozen snapshot, result, and expected write) lives as
 * JSONB on the attempt row.
